An impact evaluation is a
specific type of evaluation that

00:00:06.561 --> 00:00:10.620
measures the causal effect of an
intervention on an outcome or

894bb9ab-cd6d-4bbb-8e4b-84d83960280f-2
00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.200
outcomes.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.842
Impact evaluations answer
cause-and-effect questions about

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:19.200
interventions, also known as
questions of attribution.

They show us which outcomes,
whether positive or negative,

In the field of impact
evaluation, we have a specific

00:00:29.314 --> 00:00:31.240
technical definition of impact.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.048
Impact is the causal effect of
an intervention on an outcome or

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:40.096
alternatively, the amount of an
outcome or change in an outcome

00:00:40.096 --> 00:00:42.120
attributable to an intervention.

Cause and effect are our
keywords.

Answering cause and effect
questions is what makes an

A related term is attribution.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.570
Can we say that the change in
our results that we observe is a

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.720
result of our program?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:03.315
We are careful not to use terms
such as impact, effect, or other

00:01:03.315 --> 00:01:06.567
causal terms unless we have
arrived at our evaluation

00:01:06.567 --> 00:01:09.760
results through specific methods
of causal analysis.

We will introduce you to some of
these methods later in this
